  This webpage contains a Home, Articles, and Contacts button. I removed the About button since this is the About page of the websites
the <a> is what allows the user to navigate between pages - as it is what opens up the webpage linked to the button the user clicks  -->

    <!--I took an android programming class last semester and so I am familiar with the onclick and listener built ins
  Here I used javascript to create 3 button a share on  facebook, twitter, and instagram button. I don't feel as comfortable using Atom as I do VSCode and
when working with HTML in VSCode you can include script in the html file so that is what I did instead of creating a new JS file and it worked
I put all 3 buttons in a div so that I could edit their size and other features in the accompanying CSS file -->
    <div class="buttons-container">
      <button onclick="shareOnFacebook()">Share on Facebook</button>
      <button onclick="shareOnTwitter()">Share on Twitter</button>
      <button onclick="shareOnInstagram()">Share on Instagram</button>

    </div>
<!-- This is the javascript code. There are 3 functions that use windows.open to open the facebook, twitter, and instagram pages respectively -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function shareOnFacebook(){
        window.open('https://www.facebook.com');
      }
      function shareOnTwitter(){
        window.open('https://twitter.com');
      }
      function shareOnInstagram(){
        window.open('https://instagram.com');
      }
