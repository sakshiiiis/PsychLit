    <h3>Emergence of a Peaceful Culture in Wild Baboonss</h3>
    <!--Article summary -->
    <p>The notion of cultural traditions in primates is highlighted in this article,
      as well as how these behaviours are passed down to following generations. The distinction
      between hereditary and environmental influences and how they affect monkeys' behaviour is
      also covered in the essay. The authors illustrate how a group's behaviour might alter over time
      owing to cultural traditions by using a case study of wild baboons in Kenya. They discovered that
      killing out a troop's most violent males significantly altered the troop's gender balance and decreased hostility.
      The authors contend that a variety of models, including observation and closeness to certain behaviours, are probably
      used to transmit cultural features. The essay highlights the fact that culture is a general notion that isn't necessairly unique to humans. </p>
