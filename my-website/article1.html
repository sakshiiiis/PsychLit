    <h3>Infectious Disease, behavioural flexibility and the Evolution of Culture in Primates</h3>
    <!-- Article summary -->
    <p>In particular, the costs of innovation, extractive foraging, and social learning are examined in the research as they relate to the costs of cultural transmission in primates.
       The authors explore two theories to explain this link and argue that infectious disorders constitute a large cost of cultural transmission.
        They argue that social learning and exploratory activity either make up for pre-existing infections or increase exposure to infectious agents.
        Among 127 primate species, the study discovers a favourable correlation between pathogen abundance and rates of innovation, extractive foraging,
        and social learning. Environmentally transmitted diseases were strongly correlated with rates of exploration, whereas socially contagious diseases were favourably correlated with rates
        of social learning.According to the scientists, both non-human primates and humans are believed to have evolved their cultures as a result of greater exposure to pathogens.
        The report emphasizes the necessity to weigh cultural practices' costs in addition to their advantages. The immediate costs of engaging in a behaviour and the constitutive costs related to
        acquiring the capacity to engage in a behaviour are examples of costs. The "exposure theory" in primates, which postulates that some facets of social learning and exploration result in more
        exposure to various types of parasites, is supported by the study. The study warns that because social learning reports are observational in nature and field studies of this phenomena are
        frequently undertaken without adequate controls, it is important to evaluate them carefully. To clearly describe the learning process. </p>
