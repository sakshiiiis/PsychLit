      <!-- I decided to reuse some of the code I worked on for another coding project from one of my classes
          This creates a contact form which basically allows the user to enter their name and email and submit it
          However it is really basic code so there is no verification of email or no database where any of this information is stored
          I decided to add this for authenticity and aesthetic purposes-->
      <h1>Contact Form:</h1>

      <form id="contactForm">
        <br>
      <!-- Label is basically the same thing as a headline text -->
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <!-- Input allows the user to input information into the text box created by input-->
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    <!--br is a break line which basically just creates a space betweeen lines for aesthetic purposes -->

<!--Javascript code
    an event listener is created and it waits for the user to press the submit button
  when the form is submitted the prevent default stops the page from refreshing
  when the form is submitted the alert function gives you a submitted message-->
  <script>
    document.getElementById('contactForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      alert('Form submitted successfully!');
    });
  </script>
